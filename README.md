# AppstractReader
Program to read bibliography files into mp3, v1.0

Last updated: April 16, 2021



# Setup
First, install pyttsx3 using pip or other preferred methods to install python packages.
```
pip install pyttsx3
```
If you are using Python 2.x, you may need to install Tk:
```
pip install tkinter
```

# Usage
Run Main.py on your terminal:
```
python Main.py
```
You will be prompted for an input file (.bib) and a target save file (.mp3). The contents of the
bibliography will be parsed and read to the .mp3 file. The file will read the title, author(s), 
journal, year, and abstract (if available) of each entry in the .bib file.
